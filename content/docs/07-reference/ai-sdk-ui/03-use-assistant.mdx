# `useAssistant`

Allows you to handle the client state when interacting with an OpenAI compatible assistant API.
This hook is useful when you want to integrate assistant capibilities into your application,
with the UI updated automatically as the assistant is streaming its execution.

This works in conjunction with [`AssistantResponse`](/docs/reference/stream-helpers/assistant-response) in the backend.

`useAssistant` is currently supported with `ai/react` and `ai/svelte`.
